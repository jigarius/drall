# Drall

Drall is a tool to that helps run [drush](https://www.drush.org/) commands
on multi-site Drupal installations.

> One command to *drush* them all.
> â€” [Jigarius](https://jigarius.com/about)

A big thanks and shout-out to [Symetris](https://symetris.ca/) for sponsoring
the initial development of Drall.

## Installation

Drall is listed on [Packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/jigarius/drall).
Thus, it can easily be installed using `composer` as follows:

```
composer require jigarius/drall
```

## Commands

To see a list of commands offered by Drall, run `drall list`. If you feel lost,
run `drall help` or continue reading this documentation.

### exec:drush

There are a number of ways to run `drush` commands on multiple sites.

#### With @@uri

In this method, the `--uri` option is sent to `drush`.

```
drall exec:drush --uri=@@uri core:status
```

Or simplify omit the `--uri=@@uri` and it will be added automatically.

```
drall exec:drush core:status
```

##### Example

```
$ drall core:status
drush --uri=default core:status
drush --uri=donnie core:status
drush --uri=leo core:status
drush --uri=mikey core:status
drush --uri=ralph core:status
```

Here, the `--uri` is populated with names of the subdirectories under `sites`
in which the various sites live.

#### With @@site

In this method, a site alias is sent to `drush`.

```
drall exec:drush @@site.local core:status
```

##### Example

```
$ drall exec:drush @@site.local core:status
drush @tmnt.local core:status
drush @donnie.local core:status
drush @leo.local core:status
drush @mikey.local core:status
drush @ralph.local core:status
```

Here, `@@site` is replaced with site names detected from various site alias
definitions.

### exec:shell

If you want to run non-drush commands on your sites, or run multiple commands
on each site in your multi-site Drupal installation, this command comes to the
rescue.

This command simply takes one or more shell commands, replaces placeholders
like `@@uri` or `@@site` and executes them.

**Important:** You can only use any one of the possible placeholders, e.g. if
you use `@@uri` and you cannot mix it with `@@site`.

#### Example: Usage

```
$ drall exec:shell cat web/sites/@@uri/settings.local.php
cat web/sites/default/settings.local.php
cat web/sites/donnie/settings.local.php
cat web/sites/leo/settings.local.php
cat web/sites/mikey/settings.local.php
cat web/sites/ralph/settings.local.php
```

#### Example: Multiple commands

```
$ drall exec:shell "drush @@site.dev updb -y && drush @@site.dev cim -y && drush @@site.dev cr"
```

### site:directories

Get a list of all available site directory names in the Drupal installation.
All `sites/*` directories containing a `settings.php` file are treated as
individual sites.

#### Example: Usage

```
$ drall site:directories
default
donnie.com
leo.com
mikey.com
ralph.com
```

The output can then be iterated with scripts.

#### Example: Iterating

```shell
for site in $(drall site:directories)
do
  echo "Current site: $site";
done;
```

### site:aliases

Get a list of site aliases.

#### Example: Usage

```
$ drall site:aliases
@tmnt.local
@donnie.local
@leo.local
@mikey.local
@ralph.local
```

The output can then be iterated with scripts.

#### Example: Iterating

```shell
for site in $(drall site:aliases)
do
  echo "Current site: $site";
done;
```

## Global options

This section covers some options that are supported by all `drall` commands.

### --root

Specify a Drupal project root or document root directory.

    drall --root=/path/to/drupal site:directories

### --drall-group

Specify the target site group. See the section *site groups* for more
information on site groups.

    drall exec:drush --drall-group=GROUP core:status --field=site

## Site groups

Drall allows you to group your sites so that you can run commands on these
groups using the `--drall-group` option.

### Drall groups with site aliases

In a site alias definition file, you can assign site aliases to one or more
groups like this:

```yaml
# File: tnmt.site.yml
local:
  root: /opt/drupal/web
  uri: http://tmnt.com/
  # ...
  drall:
    groups:
      - cartoon
      - action
```

This puts the alias `@tnmt.local` in the `cartoon` and `action` groups.

### Drall groups with sites.*.php

If your project doesn't use site aliases, you can still group your sites using
one or more `sites.GROUP.php` files like this:

```php
# File: sites.bluish.php
$sites['donnie.drall.local'] = 'donnie';
$sites['leo.drall.local'] = 'leo';
```

This puts the sites `donnie` and `leo` in a group named `bluish`.

## Development

Here's how you can set up a local dev environment.

- Clone the `https://github.com/jigarius/drall` repository.
  - Use a branch as per your needs.
- Run `docker compose up -d`.
- Run `docker compose start`.
- Run `make ssh` to launch a shell in the Drupal container.
- Run `make provision`.
- Run `drall --version` to test the setup.
- Run `make lint` to run linter.
- Run `make test` to run tests.

You should now be able to `make ssh` and then run `drall`. A multi-site Drupal
installation should be present at `/opt/drupal`. Oh! And Drall should be
present at `/opt/drall`.

### Hosts

To access the dev sites in your browser, add the following line to your hosts
file. It is usually located at `/etc/hosts`. This is completely optional, so
do this only if you need it.

```
127.0.0.1 tmnt.drall.local donnie.drall.local leo.drall.local mikey.drall.local ralph.drall.local
```

The sites should then be available at:
- http://tmnt.drall.local/
- http://donnie.drall.local/
- http://leo.drall.local/
- http://mikey.drall.local/
- http://ralph.drall.local/
